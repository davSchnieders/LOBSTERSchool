WARNING: You did not specify any COHP pairs in the lobsterin file. As default
WARNING: I will try to find any pairs between 1.0 and 3.0 A distance,
WARNING: but that might be wrong. If you want pCOHPs or pCOOPs, change the lobsterin!
 found 1 interaction.
abs. charge spilling:   1.12%

NOTE: The spilling is a measure for the relocation, *not* the absence of electrons.
